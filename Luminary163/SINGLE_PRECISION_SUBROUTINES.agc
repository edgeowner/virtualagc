## Filename:    SINGLE_PRECISION_SUBROUTINES.agc
## Purpose:     A section of Luminary revision 163.
##              It is part of the reconstructed source code for the first
##              (unflown) release of the flight software for the Lunar
##              Module's (LM) Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) for Apollo 14.
##              The code has been recreated from a reconstructed copy of
##              Luminary 173, as well as Luminary memos 157 amd 158.
##              It has been adapted such that the resulting bugger words
##              exactly match those specified for Luminary 163 in NASA
##              drawing 2021152N, which gives relatively high confidence
##              that the reconstruction is correct.
